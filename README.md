# magicterm

This is a program for my personal use that sets the best values for
TERM and COLORTERM possible, just in case your shell doesn't have
the best ones.

I primarily wrote this to get the best color count in emacs in a
terminal.

This might actually be overkill.  This *is* a work in progress.

This might or might not become something generic that can be
widespreadly used someday.
